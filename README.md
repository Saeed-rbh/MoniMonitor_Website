## Change delivery

After making and verifying a code change, commit and push the related files to
the configured Git remote. Keep unrelated local changes out of that commit.

## Backup and recovery

The API creates verified SQLite snapshots in `server/backups` by default. The
directory can be changed with `MONIMONITOR_BACKUP_DIR`, and the automatic
interval can be changed with `MONIMONITOR_BACKUP_INTERVAL_HOURS`.

- Automatic backups are checked when the API starts and at least every six hours.
- Retention keeps recent daily, weekly, monthly, and manual recovery points.
- Profile shows the last successful backup date and provides Backup, Download,
  and Restore controls.
- Every restore verifies the selected file and creates a pre-restore safety
  backup before replacing application data in one database transaction.
